    abstract = {Abstract This study takes the first step to bridge the gap between the pressure drag of a shallow cloud ensemble and that of an individual cloud composed of rising thermals. It is found that the pressure drag for a cloud ensemble is primarily controlled by the dynamical component. The dominance of dynamical pressure drag and its increased magnitude with height are independent of cloud lifetime and are common features of individual clouds except that the total drag of a single cloud over life cycle presents vertical oscillations. These oscillations are associated with successive rising thermals but are further complicated by the evaporation-driven downdrafts outside the cloud. The horizontal vorticity associated with the vortical structure is amplified as the thermals rise to higher altitudes due to continuous baroclinic vorticity generation. This leads to the increased magnitude of local minima of dynamical pressure perturbation with height and consequently to increased dynamical pressure drag.},

    abstract = { The convection in a fluid between horizontal conducting surfaces is a very simple example of thermal turbulence, for the mean heat transport is independent of position while the distance between these surfaces is the only geometric parameter. This paper describes measurements of the heat transport and mean velocity in such convection up to Rayleigh numbers of 1010. Six discrete transitions in the slope of the heat-transport curve were observed between Rayleigh numbers of 1700 and 1000000. Although the thermal gradients vary by an order of magnitude from a boundary to the mid-regions of the fluid, these transitions appear to agree with those deduced on an assumption of a constant thermal gradient. Various visual observations of the fluctuating velocity field are also reported. Additional vertical barriers in the fluid markedly influence the horizontal flow but have negligible effect on the heat transport. This apparent lack of uniqueness of the flow patterns associated with a given heat transport suggests a new approach to turbulent phenomena discussed in a following theoretical paper. }

    abstract = { Abstract This paper reports an intercomparison study on undisturbed trade wind cumulus convection under steady-state conditions as observed during the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) with 10 large eddy simulation (LES) models. A main objective of this study is to obtain a quantitative assessment of the quality of the turbulent dynamics for this type of boundary layer clouds as produced by the different LES codes. A 6-h simulation shows excellent model-to-model agreement of the observed vertical thermodynamical structure, reasonable agreement of variances and turbulent fluxes, and good agreement of quantities conditionally sampled within the model clouds, such as cloud cover, liquid water, and cloud updraft strength. In the second part of this paper the LES dataset is used to evaluate simple models that are used in parameterizations of current general circulation models (GCMs). Finally, the relation of this work to subsequent LES studies of more complicated regimes is discussed, and guidance is given for the design of future observational studies of shallow cumulus boundary layers. }

    abstract = {Abstract A better conceptual understanding and more realistic parameterizations of convective boundary layers in climate and weather prediction models have been major challenges in meteorological research. In particular, parameterizations of the dry convective boundary layer, in spite of the absence of water phase-changes and its consequent simplicity as compared to moist convection, typically suffer from problems in attempting to represent realistically the boundary layer growth and what is often referred to as countergradient fluxes. The eddy-diffusivity (ED) approach has been relatively successful in representing some characteristics of neutral boundary layers and surface layers in general. The mass-flux (MF) approach, on the other hand, has been used for the parameterization of shallow and deep moist convection. In this paper, a new approach that relies on a combination of the ED and MF parameterizations (EDMF) is proposed for the dry convective boundary layer. It is shown that the EDMF approach follo...}

From these equations, a model is constructed to exhibit the double diffusive behaviour of this system. As application, we consider free convection in a shallow layer, by assuming small water concentration : the medium is, in general, linearly stable, but two instability cases are exhibited : stationary instability exists for negative Rayleigh number, and oscillatory instability can exist for negative moist Rayleigh number. In realistic cases, where the moist Rayleigh number is always small, the stationary instability is the only occurring instability. Following the description of the problem of thermohaline convection, this instability may be interpreted as moisture fingers in the medium.",
