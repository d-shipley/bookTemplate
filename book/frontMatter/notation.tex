\chapter{A Note on Notation}

It is my firm belief that every text making heavy use of mathematics owes to its readers a glossary of terms and notation, \textit{especially} where that notation is unusual (or where multiple conventions currently coexist).
Whether this should be placed in the front matter or the end matter, and whether the note takes the form of a descriptive dictionary, a succinct table, some of both, or something else entirely, is up to the writer.

        Notation    & Description   \\

        $\varphi$               & A generic flow variable, assumed $\varphi(\vec{x},t)$ \\
        $\filter[g]{\varphi}$   & Spatial filter of variable $\varphi$ with respect to the kernel $g$  \\
        $\resolved{\varphi}$    & Resolved part of variable $\varphi$                   \\
        $\subfilter{\varphi}$   & Subfilter part of variable $\varphi$                  \\
        $I_i$                   & Indicator function of partition $i$                   \\
        $\resolved[i]{\varphi}$ & Resolved part of variable $\varphi$ in partition $i$  \\
        $\subfilter[i]{\varphi}$& Subfilter part of variable $\varphi$ in partition $i$ \\
        $s(a,b)$                & Generalized centred second moment of variables $a,b$  \\
        $a$                     & A scalar                                              \\
        $\vec{a}$               & A vector (components $a_\mu$)                         \\
        $\tensor{a}$            & A tensor (components $a_{\mu\nu}$)                    \\
        $\ident[d]$             & $d$-dimensional identity tensor                       \\

        $\in$                   & Set inclusion, i.e. $a \in S$ means ``$a$ is a member of the set $S$''    \\
        $\mathcal{O}$           & ``Big Oh'' asymptotic order notation                  \\
