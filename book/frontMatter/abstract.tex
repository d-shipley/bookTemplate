\chapter{Abstract}

This document is a minimal working example (MWE) to demonstrate the style, as well as some of the functionality, of Dan Shipley's \LaTeX\ book macro.
So far this has only been used for his thesis \parencite{phd:Shipley2021} and some postdoc notes.
Textbook on fluid dynamics coming in 2040\textellipsis

The MWE includes all of the front matter etc. required of a thesis at the University of Reading.
These can of course be deleted/altered if the desired document is not such a thesis.
