% you can change this to say whatever you like; unfortunately the gitinfo2 package doesn't really work with Overleaf, so if you're using Overleaf and want git-related versioning in the watermark, you'll have to either type the commit IDs etc. in manually, or add the gitHeadInfo.gin file (generated from some local copy of the git repo) into your Overleaf document tree and use the "local" option when loading gitinfo2
% remove [mark] from the package inclusion statement if you don't want the watermark to appear
